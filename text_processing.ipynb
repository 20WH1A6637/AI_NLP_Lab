The city clocks had\\n', 'only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--\\n', 'it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring\\n', 'in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like\\n', 'ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.

If I could\\n', 'work my will,\" said Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot\\n', \"who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips,\\n\", 'should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried\\n', 'with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.\\n', '\\n', '\"Nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas\\n', 'in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"But you\\n', 'don\\'t keep it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much\\n', 'good may it do you!

He stopped at the outer door to\\n', 'bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,\\n', 'cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\\n', 'them cordially.\\n', '\\n', '\"There\\'s another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge; who\\n', 'overheard him: \"my clerk, with fifteen shillings a\\n', 'week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry\\n', 'Christmas. I\\'ll retire to Bedlam.\"\\n', '\\n', \"This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had\\n\", 'let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,\\n', 'pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,\\n', \"in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in\\n\", 'their hands, and bowed to him.\\n', '\\n', '\"Scrooge and Marley\\'s, I believe,\" said one of the\\n', 'gentlemen, referring to his list. \"Have I the pleasure\\n', 'of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\"\\n', 'Scrooge replied. \"He died seven years ago, this very\\n', 'night.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented\\n', 'by his surviving partner,\" said the gentleman, presenting\\n', 'his credentials.\\n', '\\n', 'It certainly was; for they had been two kindred\\n', 'spirits. At the ominous word \"liberality,\" Scrooge\\n', 'frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials\\n', 'back.\\n', '\\n', '\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\"\\n', 'said the gentleman, taking up a pen, \"it is more than\\n', 'usually desirable that we should make some slight\\n', 'provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer\\n', 'greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in\\n', 'want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands\\n', 'are in want of common comforts, sir.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.\\n', '\\n', '\"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down\\n', 'the pen again.\\n', '\\n', '\"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge.\\n', '\"Are they still in operation?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish\\n', 'I could say they were not.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,\\n', 'then?\" said Scrooge.\\n', '\\n', '\"Both very busy, sir.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,\\n', 'that something had occurred to stop them in their\\n', 'useful course,\" said Scrooge. \"I\\'m very glad to\\n', 'hear it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish\\n', 'Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,\"\\n', 'returned the gentleman, \"a few of us are endeavouring\\n', 'to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,\\n', 'and means of warmth. We choose this time, because\\n', 'it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,\\n', 'and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down\\n', 'for?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.\\n', '\\n', '\"You wish to be anonymous?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you\\n', 'ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.\\n', \"I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't\\n\", 'afford to make idle people merry. I help to support\\n', 'the establishments I have mentioned--they cost\\n', 'enough; and those who are badly off must go there.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Many can\\'t go there; and many would rather die.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had\\n', 'better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\\n', 'Besides--excuse me--I don\\'t know that.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It\\'s\\n', 'enough for a man to understand his own business, and\\n', \"not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies\\n\", 'me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue\\n', 'their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed\\n', 'his labours with an improved opinion of himself,\\n', 'and in a more facetious temper than was usual\\n', 'with him.\\n', '\\n', 'Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that\\n', 'people ran about with flaring links, proffering their\\n', 'services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct\\n', 'them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\\n', 'whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down\\n', 'at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became\\n', 'invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the\\n', 'clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if\\n', 'its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.\\n', 'The cold became intense. In the main street, at the\\n', 'corner of the court, some labourers were repairing\\n', 'the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\\n', 'round which a party of ragged men and boys were\\n', 'gathered: warming their hands and winking their\\n', 'eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\\n', 'being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,\\n', 'and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness\\n', 'of the shops where holly sprigs and berries\\n', 'crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale\\n', \"faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'\\n\", 'trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,\\n', 'with which it was next to impossible to believe that\\n', 'such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything\\n', 'to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the\\n', 'mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks\\n', \"and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's\\n\", 'household should; and even the little tailor, whom he\\n', 'had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for\\n', 'being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up\\n', \"to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean\\n\", 'wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\\n', '\\n', 'Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting\\n', 'cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped\\n', \"the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather\\n\", 'as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then\\n', 'indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The\\n', 'owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled\\n', 'by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\\n', \"stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with\\n\", 'a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of\\n', '\\n', '        \"God bless you, merry gentleman!\\n', '         May nothing you dismay!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,\\n', 'that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to\\n', 'the fog and even more congenial frost.\\n', '\\n', 'At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house\\n', 'arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his\\n', 'stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant\\n', 'clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,\\n', 'and put on his hat.\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said\\n', 'Scrooge.\\n', '\\n', '\"If quite convenient, sir.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it\\'s not\\n', \"fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd\\n\", 'think yourself ill-used, I\\'ll be bound?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The clerk smiled faintly.\\n', '\\n', '\"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don\\'t think me ill-used,\\n', 'when I pay a day\\'s wages for no work.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The clerk observed that it was only once a year.\\n']\n"

i don\\'t mean to say that i know, of my\\nown knowledge, what there is particularly dead about\\na door-nail. i might have been inclined, myself, to\\nregard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery\\nin the trade. but the wisdom of our ancestors\\nis in the simile; and my unhallowed hands\\nshall not disturb it, or the country\\'s done for. you\\nwill therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that\\nmarley was as dead as a door-nail.\\n\\nscrooge knew he was dead? of course he did.\\nhow could it be otherwise? scrooge and he were\\npartners for i don\\'t know how many years. scrooge\\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole\\nassign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and\\nsole mourner. and even scrooge was not so dreadfully\\ncut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent\\nman of business on the very day of the funeral,\\nand solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\\n\\nthe mention of marley\\'s funeral brings me back to\\nthe point i started from. there is no doubt that marley\\nwas dead. this must be distinctly understood, or\\nnothing wonderful can come of the story i am going\\nto relate. if we were not perfectly convinced that\\nhamlet\\'s father died before the play began, there\\nwould be nothing more remarkable in his taking a\\nstroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged\\ngentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy\\nspot--say saint paul\\'s churchyard for instance--\\nliterally to astonish his son\\'s weak mind.\\n\\nscrooge never painted out old marley\\'s name.\\nthere it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse\\ndoor: scrooge and marley. the firm was known as\\nscrooge and marley. sometimes people new to the\\nbusiness called scrooge scrooge, and sometimes marley,\\nbut he answered to both names. it was all the\\nsame to him.\\n\\noh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,\\nscrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,\\nclutching, covetous, old sinner! hard and sharp as flint,\\nfrom which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;\\nsecret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. the\\ncold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed\\nnose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his\\neyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his\\ngrating voice. a frosty rime was on his head, and on his\\neyebrows, and his wiry chin. he carried his own low\\ntemperature always about with him; he iced his office in\\nthe dog-days; and didn\\'t thaw it one degree at christmas.\\n\\nexternal heat and cold had little influence on\\nscrooge. no warmth could warm, no wintry weather\\nchill him. no wind that blew was bitterer than he,\\nno falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no\\npelting rain less open to entreaty. foul weather didn\\'t\\nknow where to have him. the heaviest rain, and\\nsnow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage\\nover him in only one respect. they often \"came down\"\\nhandsomely, and scrooge never did.\\n\\nnobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with\\ngladsome looks, \"my dear scrooge, how are you?\\nwhen will you come to see me?\" no beggars implored\\nhim to bestow a trifle, no children asked him\\nwhat it was o\\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all\\nhis life inquired the way to such and such a place, of\\nscrooge. even the blind men\\'s dogs appeared to\\nknow him; and when they saw him coming on, would\\ntug their owners into doorways and up courts; and\\nthen would wag their tails as though they said, \"no\\neye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\\n\\nbut what did scrooge care! it was the very thing\\nhe liked. to edge his way along the crowded paths\\nof life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,\\nwas what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to scrooge.\\n\\nonce upon a time--of all the good days in the year,\\non christmas eve--old scrooge sat busy in his\\ncounting-house. it was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy\\nwithal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,\\ngo wheezing up and down, beating their hands\\nupon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the\\npavement stones to warm them. the city clocks had\\nonly just gone three, but it was quite dark already--\\nit had not been light all day--and candles were flaring\\nin the windows of the neighbouring offices, like\\nruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. the fog\\ncame pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was\\nso dense without, that although the court was of the\\nnarrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.\\nto see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring\\neverything, one might have thought that nature\\nlived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\\n\\nthe door of scrooge\\'s counting-house was open\\nthat he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a\\ndismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying\\nletters. scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\\'s\\nfire was so very much smaller that it looked like one\\ncoal. but he couldn\\'t replenish it, for scrooge kept\\nthe coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the\\nclerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted\\nthat it would be necessary for them to part. wherefore\\nthe clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to\\nwarm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being\\na man of a strong imagination, he failed.\\n\\n\"a merry christmas, uncle! god save you!\" cried\\na cheerful voice. it was the voice of scrooge\\'s\\nnephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was\\nthe first intimation he had of his approach.\\n\\n\"bah!\" said scrooge, \"humbug!\"\\n\\nhe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the\\nfog and frost, this nephew of scrooge\\'s, that he was\\nall in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his\\neyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\\n\\n\"christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said scrooge\\'s\\nnephew. \"you don\\'t mean that, i am sure?\"\\n\\n\"i do,\" said scrooge. \"merry christmas! what\\nright have you to be merry? what reason have you\\nto be merry? you\\'re poor enough.\"\\n\\n\"come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"what\\nright have you to be dismal? what reason have you\\nto be morose? you\\'re rich enough.\"\\n\\nscrooge having no better answer ready on the spur\\nof the moment, said, \"bah!\" again; and followed it up\\nwith \"humbug.\"\\n\\n\"don\\'t be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew.\\n\\n\"what else can i be,\" returned the uncle, \"when i\\nlive in such a world of fools as this? merry christmas!\\nout upon merry christmas! what\\'s christmas\\ntime to you but a time for paying bills without\\nmoney; a time for finding yourself a year older, but\\nnot an hour richer; a time for balancing your books\\nand having every item in \\'em through a round dozen\\nof months presented dead against you? if i could\\nwork my will,\" said scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot\\nwho goes about with \\'merry christmas\\' on his lips,\\nshould be boiled with his own pudding, and buried\\nwith a stake of holly through his heart. he should!\"\\n\\n\"uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.\\n\\n\"nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep christmas\\nin your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\"\\n\\n\"keep it!\" repeated scrooge\\'s nephew. \"but you\\ndon\\'t keep it.\"\\n\\n\"let me leave it alone, then,\" said scrooge. \"much\\ngood may it do you! much good it has ever done\\nyou!\"\\n\\n\"there are many things from which i might have\\nderived good, by which i have not profited, i dare\\nsay,\" returned the nephew. \"christmas among the\\nrest. but i am sure i have always thought of christmas\\ntime, when it has come round--apart from the\\nveneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything\\nbelonging to it can be apart from that--as a\\ngood time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant\\ntime; the only time i know of, in the long calendar\\nof the year, when men and women seem by one consent\\nto open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think\\nof people below them as if they really were\\nfellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race\\nof creatures bound on other journeys. and therefore,\\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or\\nsilver in my pocket, i believe that it has done me\\ngood, and will do me good; and i say, god bless it!\"\\n\\nthe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded.\\nbecoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,\\nhe poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark\\nfor ever.\\n\\n\"let me hear another sound from you,\" said\\nscrooge, \"and you\\'ll keep your christmas by losing\\nyour situation! you\\'re quite a powerful speaker,\\nsir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"i wonder you\\ndon\\'t go into parliament.\"\\n\\n\"don\\'t be angry, uncle. come! dine with us to-morrow.\"\\n\\nscrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he\\ndid. he went the whole length of the expression,\\nand said that he would see him in that extremity first.\\n\\n\"but why?\" cried scrooge\\'s nephew. \"why?\"\\n\\n\"why did you get married?\" said scrooge.\\n\\n\"because i fell in love.\"\\n\\n\"because you fell in love!\" growled scrooge, as if\\nthat were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous\\nthan a merry christmas. \"good afternoon!\"\\n\\n\"nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before\\nthat happened. why give it as a reason for not\\ncoming now?\"\\n\\n\"good afternoon,\" said scrooge.\\n\\n\"i want nothing from you; i ask nothing of you;\\nwhy cannot we be friends?\"\\n\\n\"good afternoon,\" said scrooge.\\n\\n\"i am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so\\nresolute. we have never had any quarrel, to which i\\nhave been a party. but i have made the trial in\\nhomage to christmas, and i\\'ll keep my christmas\\nhumour to the last. so a merry christmas, uncle!\"\\n\\n\"good afternoon!\" said scrooge.\\n\\n\"and a happy new year!\"\\n\\n\"good afternoon!\" said scrooge.\\n\\nhis nephew left the room without an angry word,\\nnotwithstanding. he stopped at the outer door to\\nbestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,\\ncold as he was, was warmer than scrooge; for he returned\\nthem cordially.\\n\\n\"there\\'s another fellow,\" muttered scrooge; who\\noverheard him: \"my clerk, with fifteen shillings a\\nweek, and a wife and family, talking about a merry\\nchristmas. i\\'ll retire to bedlam.\"\\n\\nthis lunatic, in letting scrooge\\'s nephew out, had\\nlet two other people in. they were portly gentlemen,\\npleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,\\nin scrooge\\'s office. they had books and papers in\\ntheir hands, and bowed to him.\\n\\n\"scrooge and marley\\'s, i believe,\" said one of the\\ngentlemen, referring to his list. \"have i the pleasure\\nof addressing mr. scrooge, or mr. marley?\"\\n\\n\"mr. marley has been dead these seven years,\"\\nscrooge replied. \"he died seven years ago, this very\\nnight.\"\\n\\n\"we have no doubt his liberality is well represented\\nby his surviving partner,\" said the gentleman, presenting\\nhis credentials.\\n\\nit certainly was; for they had been two kindred\\nspirits. at the ominous word \"liberality,\" scrooge\\nfrowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials\\nback.\\n\\n\"at this festive season of the year, mr. scrooge,\"\\nsaid the gentleman, taking up a pen, \"it is more than\\nusually desirable that we should make some slight\\nprovision for the poor and destitute, who suffer\\ngreatly at the present time. many thousands are in\\nwant of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands\\nare in want of common comforts, sir.\"\\n\\n\"are there no prisons?\" asked scrooge.\\n\\n\"plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down\\nthe pen again.\\n\\n\"and the union workhouses?\" demanded scrooge.\\n\"are they still in operation?\"\\n\\n\"they are. still,\" returned the gentleman, \"i wish\\ni could say they were not.\"\\n\\n\"the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour,\\nthen?\" said scrooge.\\n\\n\"both very busy, sir.\"\\n\\n\"oh! i was afraid, from what you said at first,\\nthat something had occurred to stop them in their\\nuseful course,\" said scrooge. \"i\\'m very glad to\\nhear it.\"\\n\\n\"under the impression that they scarcely furnish\\nchristian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,\"\\nreturned the gentleman, \"a few of us are endeavouring\\nto raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink,\\nand means of warmth. we choose this time, because\\nit is a time, of all others, when want is keenly felt,\\nand abundance rejoices. what shall i put you down\\nfor?\"\\n\\n\"nothing!\" scrooge replied.\\n\\n\"you wish to be anonymous?\"\\n\\n\"i wish to be left alone,\" said scrooge. \"since you\\nask me what i wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.\\ni don\\'t make merry myself at christmas and i can\\'t\\nafford to make idle people merry. i help to support\\nthe establishments i have mentioned--they cost\\nenough; and those who are badly off must go there.\"\\n\\n\"many can\\'t go there; and many would rather die.\"\\n\\n\"if they would rather die,\" said scrooge, \"they had\\nbetter do it, and decrease the surplus population.\\nbesides--excuse me--i don\\'t know that.\"\\n\\n\"but you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.\\n\\n\"it\\'s not my business,\" scrooge returned. \"it\\'s\\nenough for a man to understand his own business, and\\nnot to interfere with other people\\'s. mine occupies\\nme constantly. good afternoon, gentlemen!\"\\n\\nseeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue\\ntheir point, the gentlemen withdrew. scrooge resumed\\nhis labours with an improved opinion of himself,\\nand in a more facetious temper than was usual\\nwith him.\\n\\nmeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that\\npeople ran about with flaring links, proffering their\\nservices to go before horses in carriages, and conduct\\nthem on their way. the ancient tower of a church,\\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down\\nat scrooge out of a gothic window in the wall, became\\ninvisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the\\nclouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if\\nits teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.\\nthe cold became intense. in the main street, at the\\ncorner of the court, some labourers were repairing\\nthe gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were\\ngathered: warming their hands and winking their\\neyes before the blaze in rapture. the water-plug\\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,\\nand turned to misanthropic ice. the brightness\\nof the shops where holly sprigs and berries\\ncrackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale\\nfaces ruddy as they passed. poulterers\\' and grocers\\'\\ntrades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,\\nwith which it was next to impossible to believe that\\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything\\nto do. the lord mayor, in the stronghold of the\\nmighty mansion house, gave orders to his fifty cooks\\nand butlers to keep christmas as a lord mayor\\'s\\nhousehold should; and even the little tailor, whom he\\nhad fined five shillings on the previous monday for\\nbeing drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up\\nto-morrow\\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean\\nwife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\\n\\nfoggier yet, and colder. piercing, searching, biting\\ncold. if the good saint dunstan had but nipped\\nthe evil spirit\\'s nose with a touch of such weather\\nas that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then\\nindeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. the\\nowner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled\\nby the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\\nstooped down at scrooge\\'s keyhole to regale him with\\na christmas carol: but at the first sound of\\n\\n        \"god bless you, merry gentleman!\\n         may nothing you dismay!\"\\n\\nscrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,\\nthat the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to\\nthe fog and even more congenial frost.\\n\\nat length the hour of shutting up the counting-house\\narrived. with an ill-will scrooge dismounted from his\\nstool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant\\nclerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,\\nand put on his hat.\\n\\n\"you\\'ll want all day to-morrow, i suppose?\" said\\nscrooge.\\n\\n\"if quite convenient, sir.\"\\n\\n\"it\\'s not convenient,\" said scrooge, \"and it\\'s not\\nfair. if i was to stop half-a-crown for it, you\\'d\\nthink yourself ill-used, i\\'ll be bound?\"\\n\\nthe clerk smiled faintly.\\n\\n\"and yet,\" said scrooge, \"you don\\'t think me ill-used,\\nwhen i pay a day\\'s wages for no work.\"\\n\\nthe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\\n'"

carol         produced by jose menendez     a christmas carol  in prose being a ghost story of christmas  by charles dickens    preface  i have endeavoured in this ghostly little book  to raise the ghost of an idea  which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves  with each other  with the season  or with me   may it haunt their houses pleasantly  and no one wish to lay it   their faithful friend and servant                                     c  d  december           contents  stave   i  marley s ghost stave  ii  the first of the three spirits stave iii  the second of the three spirits stave  iv  the last of the spirits stave   v  the end of it    stave i   marley s ghost  marley was dead  to begin with  there is no doubt whatever about that  the register of his burial was signed by the clergyman  the clerk  the undertaker  and the chief mourner  scrooge signed it  and scrooge s name was good upon  change  for anything he chose to put his hand to  old marley was as dead as a door nail   mind  i don t mean to say that i know  of my own knowledge  what there is particularly dead about a door nail  i might have been inclined  myself  to regard a coffin nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade  but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile  and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it  or the country s done for  you will therefore permit me to repeat  emphatically  that marley was as dead as a door nail   scrooge knew he was dead  of course he did  how could it be otherwise  scrooge and he were partners for i don t know how many years  scrooge was his sole executor  his sole administrator  his sole assign  his sole residuary legatee  his sole friend  and sole mourner  and even scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event  but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral  and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain   the mention of marley s funeral brings me back to the point i started from  there is no doubt that marley was dead  this must be distinctly understood  or nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going to relate  if we were not perfectly convinced that hamlet s father died before the play began  there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night  in an easterly wind  upon his own ramparts  than there would be in any other middle aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot  say saint paul s churchyard for instance   literally to astonish his son s weak mind   scrooge never painted out old marley s name  there it stood  years afterwards  above the warehouse door  scrooge and marley  the firm was known as scrooge and marley  sometimes people new to the business called scrooge scrooge  and sometimes marley  but he answered to both names  it was all the same to him   oh  but he was a tight fisted hand at the grind stone  scrooge  a squeezing  wrenching  grasping  scraping  clutching  covetous  old sinner  hard and sharp as flint  from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire  secret  and self contained  and solitary as an oyster  the cold within him froze his old features  nipped his pointed nose  shrivelled his cheek  stiffened his gait  made his eyes red  his thin lips blue  and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice  a frosty rime was on his head  and on his eyebrows  and his wiry chin  he carried his own low temperature always about with him  he iced his office in the dog days  and didn t thaw it one degree at christmas   external heat and cold had little influence on scrooge  no warmth could warm  no wintry weather chill him  no wind that blew was bitterer than he  no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose  no pelting rain less open to entreaty  foul weather didn t know where to have him  the heaviest rain  and snow  and hail  and sleet  could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect  they often  came down  handsomely  and scrooge never did   nobody ever stopped him in the street to say  with gladsome looks   my dear scrooge  how are you  when will you come to see me   no beggars implored him to bestow a trifle  no children asked him what it was o clock  no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place  of scrooge  even the blind men s dogs appeared to know him  and when they saw him coming on  would tug their owners into doorways and up courts  and then would wag their tails as though they said   no eye at all is better than an evil eye  dark master    but what did scrooge care  it was the very thing he liked  to edge his way along the crowded paths of life  warning all human sympathy to keep its distance  was what the knowing ones call  nuts  to scrooge   once upon a time  of all the good days in the year  on christmas eve  old scrooge sat busy in his counting house  it was cold  bleak  biting weather  foggy withal  and he could hear the people in the court outside  go wheezing up and down  beating their hands upon their breasts  and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them  the city clocks had only just gone three  but it was quite dark already   it had not been light all day  and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices  like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air  the fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole  and was so dense without  that although the court was of the narrowest  the houses opposite were mere phantoms  to see the dingy cloud come drooping down  obscuring everything  one might have thought that nature lived hard by  and was brewing on a large scale   the door of scrooge s counting house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk  who in a dismal little cell beyond  a sort of tank  was copying letters  scrooge had a very small fire  but the clerk s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal  but he couldn t replenish it  for scrooge kept the coal box in his own room  and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel  the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part  wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter  and tried to warm himself at the candle  in which effort  not being a man of a strong imagination  he failed    a merry christmas  uncle  god save you   cried a cheerful voice  it was the voice of scrooge s nephew  who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach    bah   said scrooge   humbug    he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost  this nephew of scrooge s  that he was all in a glow  his face was ruddy and handsome  his eyes sparkled  and his breath smoked again    christmas a humbug  uncle   said scrooge s nephew   you don t mean that  i am sure     i do   said scrooge   merry christmas  what right have you to be merry  what reason have you to be merry  you re poor enough     come  then   returned the nephew gaily   what right have you to be dismal  what reason have you to be morose  you re rich enough    scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment  said   bah   again  and followed it up with  humbug     don t be cross  uncle   said the nephew    what else can i be   returned the uncle   when i live in such a world of fools as this  merry christmas  out upon merry christmas  what s christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money  a time for finding yourself a year older  but not an hour richer  a time for balancing your books and having every item in  em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you  if i could work my will   said scrooge indignantly   every idiot who goes about with  merry christmas  on his lips  should be boiled with his own pudding  and buried with a stake of holly through his heart  he should     uncle   pleaded the nephew    nephew   returned the uncle sternly   keep christmas in your own way  and let me keep it in mine     keep it   repeated scrooge s nephew   but you don t keep it     let me leave it alone  then   said scrooge   much good may it do you  much good it has ever done you     there are many things from which i might have derived good  by which i have not profited  i dare say   returned the nephew   christmas among the rest  but i am sure i have always thought of christmas time  when it has come round  apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin  if anything belonging to it can be apart from that  as a good time  a kind  forgiving  charitable  pleasant time  the only time i know of  in the long calendar of the year  when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut up hearts freely  and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave  and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys  and therefore  uncle  though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket  i believe that it has done me good  and will do me good  and i say  god bless it    the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded  becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety  he poked the fire  and extinguished the last frail spark for ever    let me hear another sound from you   said scrooge   and you ll keep your christmas by losing your situation  you re quite a powerful speaker  sir   he added  turning to his nephew   i wonder you don t go into parliament     don t be angry  uncle  come  dine with us to morrow    scrooge said that he would see him  yes  indeed he did  he went the whole length of the expression  and said that he would see him in that extremity first    but why   cried scrooge s nephew   why     why did you get married   said scrooge    because i fell in love     because you fell in love   growled scrooge  as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas   good afternoon     nay  uncle  but you never came to see me before that happened  why give it as a reason for not coming now     good afternoon   said scrooge    i want nothing from you  i ask nothing of you  why cannot we be friends     good afternoon   said scrooge    i am sorry  with all my heart  to find you so resolute  we have never had any quarrel  to which i have been a party  but i have made the trial in homage to christmas  and i ll keep my christmas humour to the last  so a merry christmas  uncle     good afternoon   said scrooge    and a happy new year     good afternoon   said scrooge   his nephew left the room without an angry word  notwithstanding  he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk  who  cold as he was  was warmer than scrooge  for he returned them cordially    there s another fellow   muttered scrooge  who overheard him   my clerk  with fifteen shillings a week  and a wife and family  talking about a merry christmas  i ll retire to bedlam    this lunatic  in letting scrooge s nephew out  had let two other people in  they were portly gentlemen  pleasant to behold  and now stood  with their hats off  in scrooge s office  they had books and papers in their hands  and bowed to him    scrooge and marley s  i believe   said one of the gentlemen  referring to his list   have i the pleasure of addressing mr  scrooge  or mr  marley     mr  marley has been dead these seven years   scrooge replied   he died seven years ago  this very night     we have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner   said the gentleman  presenting his credentials   it certainly was  for they had been two kindred spirits  at the ominous word  liberality   scrooge frowned  and shook his head  and handed the credentials back    at this festive season of the year  mr  scrooge   said the gentleman  taking up a pen   it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute  who suffer greatly at the present time  many thousands are in want of common necessaries  hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts  sir     are there no prisons   asked scrooge    plenty of prisons   said the gentleman  laying down the pen again    and the union workhouses   demanded scrooge   are they still in operation     they are  still   returned the gentleman   i wish i could say they were not     the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour  then   said scrooge    both very busy  sir     oh  i was afraid  from what you said at first  that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course   said scrooge   i m very glad to hear it     under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude   returned the gentleman   a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink  and means of warmth  we choose this time  because it is a time  of all others  when want is keenly felt  and abundance rejoices  what shall i put you down for     nothing   scrooge replied    you wish to be anonymous     i wish to be left alone   said scrooge   since you ask me what i wish  gentlemen  that is my answer  i don t make merry myself at christmas and i can t afford to make idle people merry  i help to support the establishments i have mentioned  they cost enough  and those who are badly off must go there     many can t go there  and many would rather die     if they would rather die   said scrooge   they had better do it  and decrease the surplus population  besides  excuse me  i don t know that     but you might know it   observed the gentleman    it s not my business   scrooge returned   it s enough for a man to understand his own business  and not to interfere with other people s  mine occupies me constantly  good afternoon  gentlemen    seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point  the gentlemen withdrew  scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself  and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him   meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so  that people ran about with flaring links  proffering their services to go before horses in carriages  and conduct them on their way  the ancient tower of a church  whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily
